AutoFitTextView
===============

A TextView that automatically fit its font and line count based on its available size and content

This code is heavily based on the next StackOverflow post:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16017165/auto-fit-textview-for-android/21851239

Note that even though the sample is of API 16, it should work fine on most cases for much older versions.

This is not a requirement. It's more of a suggestion, because older versions might have issues as a cause of this bug:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=22493 , which affects API 12-15 (including).
